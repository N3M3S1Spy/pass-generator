</br>
A tool used to generate a wordlist from user input, in order to use for password dictionary attacks

## How it works
<img width="720" src="https://github.com/flashnuke/pass-generator/assets/59119926/061c39c1-f14c-403b-ad57-d44979e01149">

1. The program promts the user for input (words, numbers, dates...)
2. Generates a wordlist out of all subsets inside the powerset, using different separators and text manipulation
3. Filters out irrelevant passwords (long / short ones, etc)
4. Saves result into an output file

# Usage
```bash
python3 pass-generator.py
```

### Usage notes
*  Password properties can be set using cmdline arguments, run `python3 pass-generator.py -h` for more details
*  The time complexity of adding an additional word (assuming its capitalized/uncapitalized version is not added is $O(2^n)$, if generation time takes too long consider passing less separators (`-s`) or using less words
